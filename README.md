# Contact Form – Serverless Project

This is a **serverless contact form** built with **AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and SES**, and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.
When a user submits the form, the request is processed through API Gateway, executed in Lambda, and an email is sent using Amazon SES.

## Features
- Frontend hosted on **GitHub Pages**
- Backend powered by **AWS Lambda** (Node.js/Python)
- Email delivery via **Amazon SES**
- Secure, scalable, and serverless — no traditional web server needed

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTMLand CSS
- **Backend:** AWS Lambda + API Gateway
- **Email Service:** Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages

## How It Works
1. User submits the form on the webpage.
2. The request is sent to an **API Gateway endpoint**.
3. API Gateway triggers a **Lambda function**.
4. Lambda calls **SES** to send the email to the specified recipient.
5. The user sees a success/failure message on the page.
